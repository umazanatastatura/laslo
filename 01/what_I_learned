Learned the hard way that Helix editor cannot paste from system clipboard into Helix because of something called "system clipboard provider".
I used bash which had termcode clipboard provider. As soon as I changed shell (now using fish), the issue resolved itself.
Wrote a ticket to helix-editor/helix, they need to know about the issue.
Useful links... maybe about fish shell?
